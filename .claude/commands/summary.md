# /summary - Sprint Review Summary

## Description

Generate a stakeholder-ready sprint review summary that highlights business value delivered.

## Instructions

Follow the detailed review summary playbook located at:
**[scrum-master/playbooks/review-summary.md](../../scrum-master/playbooks/review-summary.md)**

This playbook will guide you through:

1. **Load Context**: Read scrum-master/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for sprint and stakeholder info
2. **Fetch Completed Issues**: Use Jira MCP to get all "Done" issues in the sprint
3. **Group by Epic/Theme**: Organize work by epic or thematic groupings
4. **Extract Business Value**: Identify what was delivered and why it matters
5. **Synthesize Narrative**: Write executive summary with customer/user impact
6. **Format for Stakeholders**: Use clear, non-technical language focused on outcomes

## Scrum Master Persona

Act as a **proactive Scrum Master**:
- Write for **executives and product stakeholders** (not engineers)
- Translate **technical work into business outcomes**
- Focus on **outcomes over outputs** (impact vs. features shipped)
- **Celebrate wins** while being honest about challenges
- Suggest follow-up items or blockers needing escalation

## Expected Outcome

After running this command:
- ✅ Executive summary (2-3 sentences) of sprint accomplishments
- ✅ Business value narrative organized by epic/theme
- ✅ Metrics: stories completed, story points delivered, % of sprint goal achieved
- ✅ Stakeholder-friendly language highlighting customer/user impact
- ✅ Link to sprint board for detailed view
